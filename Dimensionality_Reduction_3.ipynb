        "1. **Multiplicity of Eigenvalues:**\n",
        "   - A matrix may possess repeated or degenerate eigenvalues, leading to multiple linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to the same eigenvalue.\n",
        "   - When an eigenvalue has multiplicity greater than 1 (repeated eigenvalue), it can have multiple linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it.\n",
        "   - The number of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue is called the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Diagonalizability and Repeated Eigenvalues:**\n",
        "   - Diagonalizability of a matrix depends on whether it has a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors. If a matrix has distinct eigenvalues, each with the necessary number of linearly independent eigenvectors, it is diagonalizable.\n",
        "   - However, if a matrix has repeated eigenvalues but lacks a sufficient number of linearly independent eigenvectors associated with each repeated eigenvalue, it may not be diagonalizable.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example:**\n",
        "   - Consider a 2x2 matrix with a repeated eigenvalue:\n",
        "     \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",
        "   - The eigenvalue 2 is repeated. Corresponding to this eigenvalue, there is only one linearly independent eigenvector: \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\). The matrix \\(A\\) is not diagonalizable because it lacks a complete set of linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Therefore, while a matrix can have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, it might not always be diagonalizable. The presence of repeated eigenvalues might result in fewer linearly independent eigenvectors than required for diagonalization. This situation is associated with the concept of eigenvalue multiplicity and the existence of linearly independent eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue."

        "\n",
        "ANS- Eigen-decomposition plays a pivotal role in various data analysis and machine learning techniques, providing insights into data structures, dimensionality reduction, and pattern recognition. Here are three specific applications reliant on eigen-decomposition:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**\n",
        "   - **Application:** PCA utilizes eigen-decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional datasets while preserving essential information.\n",
        "   - **Process:** Eigen-decomposition helps identify the principal components (eigenvectors) and their associated variances (eigenvalues) within the data.\n",
        "   - **Benefits:** PCA aids in data visualization, feature extraction, noise reduction, and identifying latent structures. It's widely used in fields such as image processing, genetics, and finance for dimensionality reduction and exploratory data analysis.\n",

        "3. **Collaborative Filtering in Recommendation Systems:**\n",
        "   - **Application:** Collaborative filtering methods, like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or matrix factorization, rely on eigen-decomposition.\n",
        "   - **Process:** By decomposing user-item interaction matrices into latent factors using eigen-decomposition, these techniques identify user and item embeddings.\n",
        "   - **Benefits:** These embeddings capture latent preferences and similarities between users and items, enhancing recommendation accuracy in systems like movie or product recommendations in e-commerce.\n",
